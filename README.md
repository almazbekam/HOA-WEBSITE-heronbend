# HeronBend HOA Website — Community Portal & Admin Dashboard
# https://heronbend.web.app/

This project is a modern, user-friendly **Homeowners Association (HOA) website** built for my local community. It provides a central place where residents can stay informed, view updates, and engage with HOA activities — while administrators can manage content through an active admin portal.

The goal of this project was to make communication easier, improve transparency, and create a better online experience for my local community.
